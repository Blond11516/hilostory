If using VS Code, make sure to [use the workspace version of TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-the-workspace-version-of-typescript).
VS Code doesn't automatically detect the correct version because the `node_modules` directory
isn't at the root of the workspace.
